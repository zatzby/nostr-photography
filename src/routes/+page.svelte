        but together they are even more powerful.</h1>

    <p class="text-2xl mb-20">This website is a work in progress, and is still finding its identity.
        <br/> It is one one thing to have a domain, but another to build on it... so here I am looking for you!
         <br/> I need help to build it and am taking all ideas. </p>
         
    <p class="text-2xl mb-40">Current ideas include using this site as: 
        <li class="mt-5">a relay dedicated to photography</li>
        <li class="mt-5">a marketplace for photographers to sell their photography</li>
        <li class="mt-5">a photography forum for professionals and amateurs</li>
        <li class="mt-5">a photography microapp like instagram back when it was photos only</li>
        <li class="mt-5">Your idea here...</li>
    </p>
